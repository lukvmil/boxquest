This is the codebase for my experimental social media platform, BoxQuest. Check it out at [boxquest.org](https://boxquest.org)!

# a brief description

BoxQuest is an experimental social platform and interface for the physical world focused on real interaction, social connection, and a sense of place.

Users interact with physical objects (currently cards) that are tagged with a unique QR code. Scanning the code lets users access a thread associated with the object and add their own entry to it. Each entry is composed of an image, geotagged location, and message. The thread shows the path that the object took through time and space to get to its current holder. By only allowing the current holder to post in the thread, the object passes from person to person, each adding their own entry marking its spot in space and time.

On top of this system, each thread also comes with a goal or topic, called a “quest” attached to it. The first person to use the tag decides its quest and writes instructions on how to pursue it. Possible quests could range from  “take a picture of your pet” or “pick up litter” to “send this card around the world and bring it back to me” or “do a good deed and pay it forward”.

This concept was inspired by Karl Schroeder’s “The Suicide of Our Troubles” in which a mixed reality game begins to catalogue and incorporate real world objects and places. The system eventually gives rise to AI-powered characters who seek “suicide” by resolving the environmental issues they represent.

I had originally imagined an approach similar to this story, in which gamification and tokenomics could incentivize a decentralized network of users to perform physical actions on behalf of other users or algorithms. However as I started to build out the prototype I realized how reductive this model was, which could easily lead to another exploitative gig work platform. If instead BoxQuest could socially organize people by building interest and connections to the physical world, it could be an effective force for good!

BoxQuest is a genuinely new spatial architecture for social media, and for once “space” actually means space. I found that social interaction itself can be powerful and build real networks. The physical exchange of tagged items, sense of communal investment in a quest, and positive engagement it encourages aren’t present on any other platform. Furthermore, this approach also naturally facilitates organic growth of the platform. Each time a tag is passed on, a new user is introduced to BoxQuest and instructed how to use it.
